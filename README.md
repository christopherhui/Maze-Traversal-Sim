# Maze Traversal Sim
### Create mazes 
Create your own mazes by either going to the drop down menu and clicking new, and you have the ability to create dimensions of your maze to be from 3 by 3 to 30 by 30.

### Save and Load mazes
You can save your images to a text file. Note that everything in the textfile will be overwritten, and you can also load your image to a given text file. 

### Maze Editor
Click on the buttons on the bottom to select it, and then click on the maze blocks to change the block type of it.

### Traversal
The maze does a Breadth First Search maze traversal on the current maze, highlighting in grey the traversed blocks, and green for the path, given that a path exists. Note that you have to click on the traversal button, then click on the right hand corner of your selected maze to update the colors.

## Bugs and Notes
- If you move the start button to other places around the maze, sometimes the traversal breaks.
- Everything else has been tested with some degree, I do think I need to do more thorough testing though.
- I plan on making the option to clear out the blocks so that you could be able to traverse it multiple times without seeing the traversed and path blocks.
- Also let me know what else I should do!
